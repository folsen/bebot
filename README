# bebot

This using a simple tree AI to figure out the best moves in Bejeweled and uses java.awt.Robot for image analysis.

## Installation

lein deps

## Usage

After you've set everything up you should open up a repl with lein repl from the root folder.

Bring up the game window and start a game (the closer the game window is to the upper right corner the better).
Now type (calibrate) in the repl.

When it's calibrated successfully (if it doesn't calibrate then you probably need to change the color scheme in the code) you only have to run:

(run true false)

to start a game. 
The first parameter says it will count down from 5. The second parameter is wether it should look ahead a move or not.
